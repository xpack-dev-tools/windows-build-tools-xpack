## Improvements

The GNU ARM Eclipse Windows Build Tools v2.4 package includes the **version 4.1 of GNU make** (built from MSYS2 source files), and version **1.24.0-git of BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for sh/rm/echo.

In addition to using the most recent versions, the new packages install in separate folders for each version, allowing multiple versions to coexist.

Apart from v2.3 where a binary version of BusyBox was packed, in version v2.4 BusyBox is also compiled from sources, so the entire package is freshly build from sources.

The managed build plug-in generally auto-detects the latest build tools version, by using the Windows registry keys or by searching several designated folders, and defaults to using it. If you need to use a different version, update the **Global Tools Paths** (or **Workspace Tools Paths**) in C/C++ → Build preferences.

Please note that it is no longer required to manually update the environment PATH, if properly set in the preferences page (as **Build tools folder**), the plug-in automatically updates the PATH.

## Known problems

* the uninstall script has a problem and erroneously removes some registry keys and folders. **DO NOT run the uninstall.exe** since you might damage your system; instead, install the new version on top of it.
