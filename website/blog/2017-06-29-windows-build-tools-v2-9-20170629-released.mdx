## Content

The GNU MCU Eclipse Build Tools v2.9 package includes the **version 4.1 of GNU make** (built from MSYS2 source files), and version **1.26.0-git of BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for sh/rm/echo/mkdir.

## Changes

The BusyBox sources were upgraded to the latest available release.

## Known problems

* the folder structure generated by the Windows setup was wrong, it included an unnecessary level `\bin\bin`.

## Download

The new Windows Build Tools can be downloaded from the [GitHub Release]({ frontMatter.download_url }) page.

Separate setup and archive files are provided for Windows 32/64-bit systems.
