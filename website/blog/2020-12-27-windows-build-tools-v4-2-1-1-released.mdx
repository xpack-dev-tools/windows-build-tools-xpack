There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack Windows Build Tools** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

The current version is based on:

- [GNU make](https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/make/) version 4.2.1
